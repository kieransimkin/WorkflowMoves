# Render with FrameRudiments

Use [FrameRudiments](https://github.com/kieransimkin/FrameRudiments) for reusable
offline Shorts and lyric-visualiser rendering. Keep analysis in StemLab,
movement/recording playback in DanceRudiments and live web/WordPress motion in
DanceMoves. Preserve a historical generator when reproducing an approved film.

1. Identify and hash the exact authorised programme, canonical timing, artwork
   and font. Retain privacy, source rights, BPM/phase status, source sample rate
   and start-inclusive/end-exclusive bounds. Never infer canonicity from presence.
2. Reuse saved StemLab evidence. `stemlab.loops.v1` accepted-loop IDs can supply
   exact bounds; exploratory phrase candidates remain separate artist-reviewed
   explicit sample intervals. Pin any beat report, match report or N-D recording.
   Choose the exact source/match/window/projection; no automatic creative approval.
3. Build `framerudiments.project.v1` with release-specific appearance. Use native
   named/table/composite/matched routes or recording files; keep original source
   offsets and recording capture limits. One beat is 64 native pips or 16 ticks.
   Pin scene-hook inputs too. New reusable mechanics belong in the package.
4. Run `plan`, then `preflight`, then `render` into distinct new directories.
   Read the single caption/cue frame ledger and signed quantisation errors.
   Check `audio.fade_seconds`: short derivatives default to .12 qsin; an approved
   raw seam uses 0, and visualisers/Canvas default to 0. The master stays unchanged.
5. Inspect encoded frame zero, every distinct lyric/scene state, adjacent cue
   frames, representative motion and the ending at native and phone sizes.
   Check official destination overlays/actual upload preview separately; a text
   rectangle does not establish platform safety. Listen to the encoded programme
   and repeated seam. Keep technical, creative and listening states distinct.
6. Retain exact source/render/manifest hashes, software identity, command/log,
   caption ledger, alpha bounds, full decode and CFR evidence. Publication and
   EPK reconciliation remain later actions under their own authorised workflows.

Portable CLI examples (replace paths with pinned authorised inputs):

```sh
framerudiments plan release/project.json --output release/plan.json
framerudiments preflight release/project.json --output release/preflight --ffmpeg /path/ffmpeg
framerudiments render release/project.json --output release/render --ffmpeg /path/ffmpeg
```

Use a trusted Python scene hook only for release-owned drawing. It receives the
shared frame/source/output/beat/lyric/cue context; do not add another scheduler,
native sampler or encoder. Validate its custom bounds, occlusion and collisions.
Update the README/tests and submit a canonical PR for a demonstrated shared gap.

The separate runtime is `Tools/FrameRudiments/.venv`; packages and private media
are not bundled in this workflow archive. See `Tools/FrameRudiments/README.md`.
